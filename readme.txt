To think is a wonderful idea. I like it.
Be patient, give yourself some time to finish your task. Just do it.
You will be successful.
Just do yourself.
To achieve your goal. The first thing you should do is to define what's your success.
Try to be the one who live in your world. You should be the king in your own world.
Learn others' goodness and refine yourself day by day.
You will be successful. Don't be sensitive, just be careful, but let something that's not satisfying go.
Be a good man and a clever man.
